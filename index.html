    The Second Anglo-Afghan War was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan
    from 1878 to 1880, when the latter was ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, the son of former Emir Dost
    Mohammad Khan. The war was part of the Great Game between the British and Russian empires. The war was split into
    two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the British invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly
    victorious and forced the Amir - Sher Ali Khan to flee. Ali's successor Mohammad Yaqub Khan immediately sued for
    peace and the Treaty of Gandamak was then signed on 26 May 1879.The British sent an envoy and mission
    led by Sir Louis Cavagnari to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by
    Ayub
    Khan which led to the abdication of Yaqub. The second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British decisively
    defeated Ayub Khan outside Kandahar. A new Amir - Abdur Rahman Khan selected by the British, ratified and confirmed
    the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the
    British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the British Raj and the
    Russian Empire.
